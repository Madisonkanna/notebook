Bitwise operations.

add 1011 + 0110.

Taking the bitwise AND of this means that you take the low order bits (zeros) and if they're both on, the output is on.

In this case we get 0010.

If both bits are on, then it's on.

If not, they are off.

What's the use? One example is as a mask.

Let's say you have an arbitrary sequence of bits and you want to always take the low order of 3 values.

**Signed and unsiged integers.**

For the bits we have - are we dedicating all of the bits
