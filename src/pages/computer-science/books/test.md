Bit shifting

1 << 3.

1 left shif by 3.

What is the effect of this?

1 is in binary is just the bit 1. If you move i by 3 places, you now have:

1000.

Now if you look at this, counting in binary, it has 0 in the zero place, zero in the twos, zero in the 4s, and 1 in the eights. That is 8.

Shifting left by 3 is multiplying by the power of 3.

6 << 1.

What does it mean to shift a number left by 1? Well 6 is 0110.

Now you end up a 1100.

Shifting to the right halves
