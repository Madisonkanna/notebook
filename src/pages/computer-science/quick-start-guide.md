C programming

- notes from OS's course.

The type system in C is not designed to give extra protection to allow the programmer to specificy the interface to the functions etc. Instead, it's about making it easy for the compiler author by having the programmer specifiy which machine code instructions might be permitted.

The machine you are programming may do different things for a 16-bit or 32-bit integer.

```c
int main()


```
